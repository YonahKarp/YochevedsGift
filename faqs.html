                </h3>
                <p class="">
                    Donor screening takes place over the phone and electronically,
                    so we are happy to talk with potential donors regardless of where they live.
                    We can send boxes and prepaid shipping labels so you can easily ship your milk to us.
                    Of course, if you would like to drop off milk at the milk bank or a depot,
                    that’s always OK. We love to meet our donors!
                </p>

                    <span class="plus"></span> How much do I need to commit to donating?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We request that each donor commit to donating 200 ounces.
                    The cost of screening and testing is high, and our costs are lowered
                    by approved donors providing more milk. <i> You don’t have to send it all at once! </i>
                    You can if you want to, but it’s not required.
                    We find that milk stays frozen best if you send at least 100 oz. per shipment.

                    <span class="plus"></span> Can I donate my previously collected milk?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We can take previously collected milk as long as it was collected less than 6 months ago
                    and has been in the freezer the whole time. 
                    We would just need to go through the screening process with you to make sure
                    you were following the medication restrictions and weren’t sick at
                    any time while collecting the milk.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once donor screening is finished, there is no limit on how long you can be a donor.
                    We are happy to accept any milk that is pumped during the time that you are pumping for that baby.

                    <span class="plus"></span> Can you use my prenatal blood work instead of doing a new blood test?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All prospective breastmilk donors must have blood testing if the required tests
                    have not been performed by your attending health care provider within 6 months prior to donation.
                    However, some tests we require are rarely done during the prenatal period.
                    The blood test is the last step in donor screening because we need to receive
                    the first donation within 30 days of the test being done.

                    <span class="plus"></span> How does pasteurization affect the milk?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All donor milk is pasteurized to eliminate bacteria or other
                    infecting organisms that may have been present.
                    A small percentage of nutritional and immunological properties is destroyed by pasteurization,
                    but pasteurized milk retains many of its most beneficial qualities.
                    It contains many special properties that cannot be duplicated by commercial milk formulas.
