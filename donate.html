                <h2 class="dancingScript">Why Donate?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re fortunate to have a surplus supply of milk,
                    it’s a great kindness to donate for others who could urgently use it!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <span id="eligible" class="anchor"></span>
                <h2 class="dancingScript">Am I Eligible?</h2>
                <p>
                    You’re likely to qualify if you have more milk than your baby needs
                    and are generally in good health, don’t smoke, and use approved medications. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <span id="compensation" class="anchor"></span>

                <h2 class="dancingScript">Will I be compensated for my donation?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you choose to donate specifically for ill and premature babies,
                    we cannot compensate, as per the New York Milk Bank’s policies.
                    We work with the NYMB to distribute the milk to hospitals and parents in need,
                    and work within their guidelines for those infants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you choose to donate for babies that aren’t in critical need,
                    we will compensate for your time and effort at the following rates*:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>First 99 ounces donated: <b>$.90/ounce</b></li>
                    <li>From the 100th ounce through 200th ounce: <b>$1/ounce</b></li>
                    <li>For every ounce after 200: <b>$1.10/ounce</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fontFine">

                    *Milk volume is used as an indirect measure of time and effort for milk donation.
                    Milk volume will be as determined by Yocheved’s Gift, in its sole discretion.
                    We will weigh the milk, at the time and in the condition that it is received at our facility,
                    and calculate the volume based on measured weight, excluding any packaging materials,
                    using standard operating procedures.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compensation is only for milk that is qualified for use.
                    When milk is received at Yocheved’s Gift it must undergo and pass several rigorous testing procedures,
                    including but not limited to bacterial screening and drug screening.
                    Upon successful completion of these screening procedures, the milk is considered qualified for use.

                <h2 class="dancingScript">Donor Process</h2>
                <h4>There are four steps to becoming a milk donor:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>A 20-minute screening phone call</li>
                    <li>Complete forms</li>
                    <li>Take a blood test (at no cost to you)</li>
                    <li>Pump and arrange for pick up (at no cost to you)</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>The donor set-up process takes 2 - 3 weeks to complete.</h4>
                <h4>Approved donors can provide milk up to 6 months old if it was properly stored.</h4>

                <h2 class="dancingScript">Blood Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing the verbal screening and completing the medical history form,
                    donors will be notified that they are ready for the next step – a blood test.
                    All prospective donors must have a small blood sample taken for testing
                    as part of the screening process.
                    The blood test helps assure safety for the fragile babies that use the milk.
                </p>
                <h4>The cost of all blood testing will be covered.</h4>
                <p>We will inform you of a location near you where the blood can be drawn.</p>
                <p>
                    The blood is tested for antigen to the HIV-1 and -2 and Hepatitis B viruses,
                    and antibodies to Hepatitis C, and HTLV-I and –II, and syphilis. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="dancingScript">Collection and Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    We request that donors follow careful collection and storage methods.
                    The milk recipients may be the most fragile and ill infants in NICUs.
                    For the milk to be used, it will be tested for any unwanted bacteria.
                    By following the proper collection and storage methods we will be able to use all the milk that is donated.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Once a donor is approved, collection and storage guidelines will be forwarded
                    along with information about pick-ups and/or shipping.
                </p>

                <h2 class="dancingScript">Donating after the loss of a baby</h2>
                <p>
                    The birth process stimulates the hormones that produce milk.
                    For many mothers, producing milk is a difficult reminder of their loss.
                    However, some find it therapeutic to donate their milk in honor of the baby they have lost,
                    knowing that it will help other babies in need.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    The screening process is similar in consisting of a phone screening,
                    a medical history form, and a blood test. Since we can take previously collected milk,
                    you can pump and store your milk until the process is complete.
